# An Introduction to Statistical Learning

Project start date: 25 FEB 2023 \
Project end date: work in progress :-)

In this repository are the solutions to the exercises of the second edition of the book "An Introduction to Statistical 
Learning". 
The exercises are meant to be solved using R, we instead present solutions in Python.

We encourage everyone to buy an official pair of the book. We think it is an interesting, comprehensive and 
well-written manual. Above all, it's important to support the authors (the publisher a little less ;-) )
